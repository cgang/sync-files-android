> ⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** - This project is currently under active development and not yet ready for production use.

Android client implementation for File Hub personal file synchronization service. This repository contains comprehensive implementation guides for Android clients that connect to the File Hub server.

## 📌 Project Overview

File Hub is a personal file backup and synchronization service with WebDAV support and an optimized mobile sync protocol. This client repository provides:

- **Android Client**: Kotlin-based implementation with Jetpack Compose UI, MVVM architecture, and WorkManager for background sync

## 🔍 Key Features

### Sync Protocol
- **Version-based sync**: Monotonically increasing version numbers for accurate change detection
- **Change log**: Tracks all operations (create, modify, delete, move, copy)
- **Version vectors**: Detects conflicts from multiple users
- **Chunked uploads**: Resumable uploads for large files (>10MB)
- **Conditional downloads**: ETag-based caching to avoid redundant transfers

### Authentication Methods
- **Session-based** (recommended for mobile): Cookie-based authentication, 24-hour expiration
- **HTTP Basic**: Simple username/password with Base64 encoding
- **HTTP Digest**: Challenge-response authentication that never transmits passwords

### Storage and Persistence
- **File storage**: App-specific directories for downloaded files
- **Secure credentials**: Android Keystore for credential storage

### Performance Optimizations
- **Pagination**: Directory listings support offset/limit pagination
- **Bandwidth efficient**: Transfers only changed data via sync protocol
- **Background sync**: Periodic automatic synchronization
- **Network monitoring**: Adaptive behavior based on network conditions

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Android
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose (Material 3)
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Networking**: OkHttp
- **Concurrency**: Coroutines + Flow
